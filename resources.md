Here are some materials I write for teaching, codelab or public speaking in my spare time. Feel free to download, use and adapt them with appropriate credit and a link to this site. For commercial usage, please contact me first before using them.

# A Concise Handbook of TensorFlow

<img style="float: right; width: 30%" src="{{site.url}}/assets/publications/tfhandbook.png">

This handbook is a concise introduction to TensorFlow based on Eager Execution mode, trying to help researchers and developers get started with TensorFlow quickly with some basic machine learning and Python knowledge. Supported by Google China Developer Relations team and TensorFlow engineering team. Both Chinese and English version are available online for free.

**Update:**

- **Sep. 2018** - Thanks to Jeff Dean's retweet, recommendation from TensorFlow offical twitter account and engineering lead, as well as support from Google China Developer Relations team, I will write an extended version of this online handbook for publication with three awesome GDEs (Zhuohuan Li, Jingtian Peng and Jinpeng Zhu).
- **Sep. 2018** - Start using new domain `tf.wiki` donated by my friend Luke Cheng.
