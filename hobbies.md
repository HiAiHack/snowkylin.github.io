Beyond the research work in my own field, I also have some hobbies such as drawing, software development and animal protection, which enriched my spare time.

# Drawing

I love animal drawing due to the fantastic coexistance of wildness and cuteness. You can find some of my artworks at [DeviantArt](http://snowkylin.deviantart.com) or [WildDream Art](http://www.wilddream.net/user/snowkylin).

# Software Development

Building a whole complex software system alone from beginning to end might be the dream of every programmer. I am not the exception even if I do research work most of the time.

- **Course Management System of Student Association of Zhejiang University**
    - An online multi-user course management system that provides functions including course & students management, course info inquery, course choosing and so on.
    - Designed  for students in Zhejiang University to choose courses (with "second-classroom credit") offered by clubs and student associations in ZJU.
    - Independent work commissioned by [ZJUSAC](http://www.cde.zju.edu.cn/), currently running [Here](http://www.zjustjpkc.com/).
- **Wilddream Platform (beta)**
    - An easy-to-use online multi-user art gallery system with multi-language support (including Chinese!), developed by PHP (with ThinkPHP framework), MySQL, HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), Javascript (with JQuery), etc.
    - Independent work, currently running on [WildDream Art](http://www.wilddream.net).
    - With Computer Software Copyright Registration Certificate (Registration No: 2017SR111204) issued by National Copyright Administration of the PRC.

# Animal Protection

I strongly concern about ecological and environmental issues, especially animal protection. In fact, I am the 9<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> president of [Animal Protection Association of Zhejiang University](http://www.zjuapa.com) when I am in my undergraduade study (Sep. 2013 - Mar. 2016). I revived the association from 5 remaining people to one of the most influential association in Zhejiang University with 5 departments, more than 40 staffs and more than 150 members, which was awarded Outstanding Student Association of ZJU in 2014.

The regular activity of our association contains:

- Helping homeless animals in campus of Zhejiang University, including looking for adoption (with regular revisit), curing injured animals and [TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap%E2%80%93neuter%E2%80%93return) cooperated with Hangzhou government.
- Regular volunteer activity to animal rescue station, helping to clean the yard & house, wash animals, etc.
- Course "[Introduction to Animal Protection: Theory and Practice](http://data.zjuapa.com/activity.php?id=7)" available for all students in ZJU.
- Regular lecture in Zhejiang Natural Museum to convey the concept of wildlife conservation to public, especially for children.
- Field practice for wildlife survey.
